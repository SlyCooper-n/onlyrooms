## :pushpin: General Information

<!-- 
Provide general information about your project here.

- What problem does it (intend to) solve?
- What is the purpose of your project?
- Why did you undertake it?
-->

This project was developed in order to practise web development using Next.js and Firebase to provide real-time rooms. I'll be improving this project from now on to keep evolving my knowledge and maybe create something cool for people to use. I've built some small features on top of that one, like PWA and dark mode support. But that's not all, I'm aiming to add [this feedback feature](https://github.com/SlyCooper-n/feedback-widget-nlw-08) inside this web app in the near future as well as CI with Github Actions.
